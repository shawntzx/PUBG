For this analysis we only used the last dataset of the kill and match data. killed_by killer_name killer_placement killer_position_x killer_position_y map match_id time victim_name victim_placement victim_position_x victim_position_y M249 0932313woaini 7 529007.7 440035.5 MIRAMAR 2U4GBNA0YmkBbLEF24GGKLLAPoDQjAD8DoJFecsw9jUiNEkyvGCnOFxmxlo9x0cc 1209 GODusopp 11 526111.8 432951.8 Kar98k arunrunrun 6 440414.8 285918.1 MIRAMAR 2U4GBNA0YmkBbLEF24GGKLLAPoDQjAD8DoJFecsw9jUiNEkyvGCnOFxmxlo9x0cc 1096 TheOnly_0ne 13 438853.4 280981.6 Down and Out Rabbit812 6 439923.2 282419.0 MIRAMAR 2U4GBNA0YmkBbLEF24GGKLLAPoDQjAD8DoJFecsw9jUiNEkyvGCnOFxmxlo9x0cc 1096 NOAIM1 13 437034.8 282477.7 Down and Out 0932313woaini 7 530312.4 440969.0 MIRAMAR 2U4GBNA0YmkBbLEF24GGKLLAPoDQjAD8DoJFecsw9jUiNEkyvGCnOFxmxlo9x0cc 1209 liweiliwei 11 528304.4 439696.8 SCAR-L sa11y1126 3 466609.2 409546.3 MIRAMAR 2U4GBNA0YmkBbLEF24GGKLLAPoDQjAD8DoJFecsw9jUiNEkyvGCnOFxmxlo9x0cc 1793 PKBskg 5 462901.5 403350.5 Bluezone NA NA NA NA MIRAMAR 2U4GBNA0YmkBbLEF24GGKLLAPoDQjAD8DoJFecsw9jUiNEkyvGCnOFxmxlo9x0cc 1505 0932313woaini 7 495367.2 419491.3 First we take a look at the kill data set, which tracks the kill information of each game. The data set contains the following variable: kill_by: method/weapon of killing killer_name: player name of the killer killer_placement: killer final ranking of the game killer_position_x: killer x-coordinate on the map, ranging from 0 to 800000 killer_position_y: killer y-coordinate on the map, ranging from 0 to 800000 map: map of the game, there are currently four maps in PUBG, which are Erangel, Miramar, Sanhok, and Vikendi match_id: unique identification of the game, which can be mapped to the match dataset time: death time, measured by seconds victim_name: player name of the victim victim_placement: victim final ranking of the game victim_position_x: victim x-coordinate on the map, ranging from 0 to 800000 victim_position_y: victim y-coordinate on the map, ranging from 0 to 800000 From the missing pattern graph we can see that most of the data in the data set is complete, consisting of over 10 million/almost 90% of data. The next significant missingness is of the killer information, which makes sense because in PUBG player can be killed not only by other players but also other reasons such as bleeding out due to bluezone, in which case there will not be a killer. There is also missing values on victim_placement and map, which I would deem as wrong values because these information should be present in the data under any circumstance. In this case, I would consider dropping these values. date game_size match_id match_mode party_size player_assists player_dbno player_dist_ride player_dist_walk player_dmg player_kills player_name player_survive_time team_id team_placement 2017-10-31 02:41:53 95 2U4GBNA0YmmhivBOFUiipklIPVdC0DRgkX88eyhTYGiAnoXrjvEhNQHZMWi8d5y9 tpp 1 0 0 0.000 37.91984 20 0 m3xdave 106.351 100000 88 2017-10-31 02:41:53 95 2U4GBNA0YmmhivBOFUiipklIPVdC0DRgkX88eyhTYGiAnoXrjvEhNQHZMWi8d5y9 tpp 1 0 0 292.205 3457.03613 387 3 UDaddyHere 1690.021 100006 8 2017-10-31 02:41:53 95 2U4GBNA0YmmhivBOFUiipklIPVdC0DRgkX88eyhTYGiAnoXrjvEhNQHZMWi8d5y9 tpp 1 0 0 0.000 106.21590 0 0 Dummy05 103.415 100010 89 2017-10-31 02:41:53 95 2U4GBNA0YmmhivBOFUiipklIPVdC0DRgkX88eyhTYGiAnoXrjvEhNQHZMWi8d5y9 tpp 1 0 0 0.000 126.95983 91 0 NA-Wuyifan 272.838 100019 67 2017-10-31 02:41:53 95 2U4GBNA0YmmhivBOFUiipklIPVdC0DRgkX88eyhTYGiAnoXrjvEhNQHZMWi8d5y9 tpp 1 0 0 0.000 43.34671 0 0 kickinchicken 134.342 100024 81 2017-10-31 02:41:53 95 2U4GBNA0YmmhivBOFUiipklIPVdC0DRgkX88eyhTYGiAnoXrjvEhNQHZMWi8d5y9 tpp 1 1 0 0.000 218.51520 71 0 WhiteCrane 193.885 100026 74 Then we analyze the aggregated match data set, which tracks the meta data of each game The data set contains the following variable: date: date of the game game_size: total amount of players in that game match_id: unique identification of the game, which can be mapped to the kill data set match_mode: the perspective of the game, there are two kinds of perspective in PUBG, tpp (third-person-perspective) and fpp (first-person-perspective) party_size: amount of players in each group, there are three modes in party size, single (1 player/team), duo (up to 2 players/team), and squad (up to 4 players/team) player_assists: player assists in each game, assist means causing damage but not death to the other players player_dbno: play down but not out in each game, down but not out means down but got revived by teammate (only applicable in non-single mode) player_dist_ride: distance that player traveled through vehicles player_dist_walk: distance that player traveled by walking player_dmg: total player damage caused on other players player_kills: total people killed by that player player_name: - player_survive_time: total time passed before player dies/wins team_id: - team_placement: ranking of that team in that game From the missing pattern graph we can see that nearly all data in this set in complete, which makes sense because itâ€™s an aggregated match data that must have already had some human modification to ensure completeness. Almost there are very few amount of missingness in player_name, but is mostly dismissable.
